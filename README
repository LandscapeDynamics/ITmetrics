ITmetrics is an open-source R library of functions for calculating landscape
scale statistics that summarize and describe organizational complexity. In
the sense of ecosystems this is a useful way of understanding the
evolution of organizational complexity in a system (see "Ecology,
the ascendent perspective" by R.E. Ulanowicz, 1997). An array of data
recording the transitions (discrete state changes, e.g., A -> B ->
C...) for a domain can be processed through a series of ITmetrics functions
to yield descriptive measures including shannon diversity, conditional
entropy, and mutual information. Other functions for projecting
transition matrices are also included. The ITmetrics R library can be
used alone or with the PolarMetrics R library, and the repo of wrapper
scripts, "landat". If used together the process begins with a
single measure, such as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index),
and produces raster maps describing the average uncertainty of a domain
(shannon diversity), the reduction in uncertainty due to organization /
predictability (mutual information) and the average uncertainty that
is still unexplained given prior knowledge (conditional entropy). To
install in R you will first want to ensure you have the devtools package
installed.

# If you don't have it yet, install 'devtools' and 'ggplot2':
install.packages('devtools')
install.packages('ggplot2')
# Now install ITmetrics ('expm' will install automatically if not present)
devtools::install_github('LandscapeDynamics/ITmetrics')
# Refer to the manual for useful demos. Then explore and enjoy!
